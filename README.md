# VIP EPIC BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS
- Welcome to the repository for the projects within Georgia Institute of Technology's Vertical Integrated Projects with the Robotic Human Augmentation team,
also known as Exoskeleton and Prosthesis Intelligent Controls.
- Under the advisory of Dr. Aaron Young and Dr.Keya Ghonasgi.
- Subteam : Hip Exoskeleton
- Subteam of Subteam : Behavioral Analysis

Jelovy Djaja's Code

Two Folders: 
Preferences
Preferences Analysis

Preference folder contains code to run the Davidson Bradley Terry Model. We used the Davidson Bradley Terry Model to rank different assistance modes. 

Preference Analysis folder contains codes to run the statistical analysis.
Within the folder has the BL Experiments analysis and the Summer AB Experiments folders. Each of the folder contains the code we ran for each experiment. 

SUMMER AB EXPERIMENTS
- statsticsRepeatedMeasures.py = Repeated ANOVA measures tests
- averageCode.py = mean of each assistance level

BL EXPERIMENTS
- Assistance Level All Conditions = make plots with all conditions of each delay within that assistance level + assistance level mean
- Assistance Magnitude (Left and Right Separate) = plots of the means of R1, R2, L1, L2
- Assistance Magnitude Both with Scores = plots of assistance magnitude Means = R1L1, R1L2, R2L1, R2L2
- Delay All Conditions = make plots with all assistance magnitude conditions within each delay + delay level mean
- Dealy Mean = make plots with each delay condition mean
